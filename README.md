Install the docker tool, it's a developer tool, you won't have to do anything. 
Make sure powershell is installed on your computer beforehand. (Powershell is a windows verified terminal)
If using a windows/linux computer run start.ps1, if using a mac/unix use the .sh file


Ollama is the opensource llm we will be using, I have made sure that no data is shared and stays on your local computer
Install ollama, you can install it from here:
https://ollama.com/

after you install ollama using the executable file, paste this to powershell and press enter
ollama pull llama3.1:8b

You need to have the ollama app open for the llm to work
